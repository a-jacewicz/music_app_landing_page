<p style="font-size: small;">This site was designed and published as part of the COMP 333 Software Engineering class at 
    Wesleyan University. This is a training exercise. With that in mind, while none of the code on this page was AI-generated, I did 
    use Chat-GPT to generate some of the text for questions and answers, although I did edit it quite a bit for phrasing. </p>
