### Gitignore File
### For this, I referenced several websites on the topic of Gitignore files and 
### used those which seemed like they might be relevant to our situation! 
### (As based on the operating systems we use)


### For generally figuring out what a gitignore file is/why it is important, I referenced 
### https://techblost.com/how-to-setup-gitignore-file/ 


### This code came from the results found at https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore 
### and was implemented using advice from https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_ignore.asp?remote=github
